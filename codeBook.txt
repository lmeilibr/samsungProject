based on features_info.txt

The measures were taken from accelerometes (Acc) and gyroscopes(Gyro), and derivate to obtain the Jerk signals

The appended strings filtered to the tidyData are:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

variables with a "t" in the beggining are time domain values and "f" frequency domain.

XYZ -> X, Y and Z axis. 3 Measures for each characteristic liste below:
